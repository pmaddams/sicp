Equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers for the reason
Eva mentioned, which is error propagation. If you have an uncertain quantity a,
the division a / a equals 1 with no error when performing an algebraic
simplification, because we know that a is equal to itself. However, when we
evaluate a procedure that divides intervals, a / a results in 1 with an error
greater than the error of a by itself.

This means that we can only perform consistent calculations on intervals if
there is a way to guarantee that expressions are written in an algebraically
simplified form.
