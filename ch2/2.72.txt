The order of growth for encoding a symbol depends on the algorithm used to
search the tree. If we search for the highest-frequency symbols first, in the
case where symbol weights are successive powers of two, encoding the most
frequent symbol is a constant-time operation because we find it immediately. But
if we search the wrong branch first, encoding the most frequent symbol requires
traversing the entire tree because the sum of the weights of the other symbols
is less than the weight of the most frequent symbol.

Encoding the least frequent symbol is a quadratic-time operation, since we have
to search the entire remaining list of symbols at each successive node in the
tree, and we have to search a number of nodes equal to the number of symbols in
the tree.
