Unfortunately, the new-if procedure does not work like the if special form.
The if statement is short-circuiting, meaning that if the predicate is true, 
the else clause is not evaluated.

However, new-if is a procedure and works differently. The else clause must be
evaluated even if the predicate is true. For this reason, Eva's new-if procedure
does not work with tail recursion in the else clause, because the recursion
never terminates.

This would still be the case even if Eva changed the new-if procedure to use
if instead of cond:

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (if predicate
      then-clause
      else-clause))

In cases where the else clause is tail recursive, the evaluation will not 
terminate.
