Because the process generated by Louis' procedure is tree recursive rather than
linear recursive, the order of growth is theta of 2^n with respect to the depth
of the tree. Since the depth of the tree is log(n) with respect to the exponent,
the expmod process has order of growth 2^log(n), which is proportional to n.
Therefore the order of growth is linear.
