Alyssa is correct that the simpler procedure should yield a correct result.
However, she is not taking into account the amount of memory required to
calculate large exponents of large numbers. In 2017, if you were to attempt a
calculation like (10^1000)^1000 % 10, a calculation similar in scale to some
used for cryptography, you might run out of memory using Alyssa's procedure.
Obviously in this case the answer is 10, but the computer doesn't know that.
