With an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation, the expression

(test 0 (p))

will continually evaluate to itself, never terminating.

With an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation, the expression will be
expanded and finally terminate due to evaluation of the first if clause, as
follows:

(test 0 (p))

(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))

(if #t 0 (p))

0
